# Inputify

Custom HTML inputs library.

THIS IS JUST A TEST. learning how to config it :)

## About

Ive made this lib just to reuse the component in my own projects. Theres nothing really especial in it.
I dont have experience in real projects with any of the tech that I use, and that includes React, so I dont think it is well structured. Worry not! I will refactor it when possible.

## Warning

- This project isnt something serious, so I sugest to not really use it.

- There isnt any type of security aplied in the inputs.
